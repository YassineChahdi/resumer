- Write clean, well-tested code and participate in code reviews.
- Collaborate with frontend engineers and product managers to define clear service contracts.
- Implement authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms.
- Debug production issues and contribute to incident response and postmortems.
- Improve developer tooling, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment workflows.

Required Skills
- Strong experience with at least one backend programming language (e.g., Java, Go, Python, C++).
- Experience building REST or RPC-based services.
- Solid understanding of databases (SQL or NoSQL) and data modeling.
- Familiarity with containerization, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure.
- Experience writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

Nice to Have

- Knowledge of frontend fundamentals or API client development.
- Familiarity with performance profiling and capacity planning.
